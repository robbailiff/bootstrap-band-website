# Bootstrap Band Website

## Introduction

For this assignment, the aim was to create a HTML page using Bootstrap to advertise your favorite band. It should include the following:
* The page should include a header, hero, main content, sidebar and footer.
* The header should contain the band logo.
* The hero will contain a carousel with at least 3 images of the band.
* The main content will contain some information about the band and an embedded youtube video.
* The sidebar will contain (fake) information about upcoming tour dates.
* The footer will contain a copyright symbol and this year.

## What did I learn?
This was a nice refresher on Bootstrap as it has been a while since I last used it. The basics of the task were very easy to set up but I spent quite a while going through and adding all the details. I wanted to only use Bootstrap in this project (no CSS) so I spent quite a bit of time going through the documentation reading the utilies section and other parts I haven't used that much before. There are a lot of features available but the documentation really is excellent with lots of examples than can be copied and edited if you don't know how to do something. All-in-all I probably spent 4 or 5 hours playing around with this and really enjoyed the assignment.
